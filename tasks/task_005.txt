Develop the five core plugins specified in the PRD. Implement the Base plugin for foundation services. Create the CoreAPI plugin for data standardization. Integrate the DataStore plugin with the database abstraction layer. Implement the Docker plugin for container management. Set up the MQTT plugin for inter-plugin communication.
