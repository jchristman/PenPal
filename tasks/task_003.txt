# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Database Abstraction Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the DataStore layer with MongoDB adapter as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Implement a database abstraction layer that supports MongoDB initially but is designed to accommodate multiple database backends in the future. Create CRUD operations for all core data models. Implement proper indexing for performance. Include transaction support and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations for all models. Verify performance meets the 100ms response time requirement. Test with large datasets to ensure scalability for 10,000+ hosts.
